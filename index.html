  <h1>Black Cat</h1>
  <p>A black cat is a domestic feline with black fur, common across many breeds but notably the all-black Bombay, often symbolizing mystery or magic, and sometimes linked to superstition (good or bad luck) despite being generally loving, playful, and intelligent pets, with specific days like "National Black Cat Day" celebrating them. </p>
